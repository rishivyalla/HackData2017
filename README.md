# HackData2017
Project for HackData2017

The project aims to visualize datasets of Detroit, Michigan to identify zones which are under a greater threat of collapsing and require immediate attention. We have collected multiple datasets for each "feature" for the location.  
 
To start the project, install Pandas and Flask. 

Once, the installation is complete, run the HackData.py file.
